# nosql-challenge

### Overview

In this exercise, I used MongoDB in Jupyter Notebook to update and analyze a JSON dataset of different restaurant establishments (see "Resources" directory). In the 'NoSQL_setup' notebook file, I imported the establishments dataset, added an establishment that was missing, updated the datatypes of different elements, and removed other establishments in an area that I did not want included in my analysis.

In the 'NoSQL_analysis' notebook file, I filtered the establishments by various criteria including rating value, hygiene score, and location and created various pandas dataframes of establishments that matched my queries. I made extensive use of the match, sort, and limit functions to create aggregation pipelines to yield the desired documents for each dataframe.
